An intro to Java class project at UNCW; this is a simple card game made with JavaFX that combines poker rules with war game play. Players play against a computer and the aim is to get your opponent's health bar to 0 via combining cards. 
Card combinations follow poker rules (as mentioned) which means you either make runs 7,8,9, match cards 8,8, etc. Depending on your matches, there are damage multiplers (extra damage!).

Dylan Clark (me)- Created the UML and implemented into code, programmed the animations, added a restart game button, and helped bug fix. 

Michael Pedicone- Coded the main game logic, including the computer and added the card buttons on screen.

Eli Baird- Added the healthbars, helped with the game idea, and helped implement game logic.

Henry Moore- Did all the graphic design work and UI designs.

Enrique Leon- Implemented the graphic design work into fxml.
